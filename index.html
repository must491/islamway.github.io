<hr>
<p> Assalam Alaikum my brothers and sisters, </p> <br />
<p> In
this website page I will talk all about Islam, and it will be in a really simple dialect for all of you to fathom</p>
<p> before we all dive into it,
it will be better to ask 3 questions and answer to them</p>
<p>
that being said: Question 1: What does being proficient in Islam really look like?
Question 2: What are the Main Topics of Islam we need to know?
Question 3: How do you ensure your the best Muslim
even at the most turbulent times and whatever the case may
be... how do I tame my stature with Allah?</p>
<hr/>
<p>To ensure your smart in your religion, you should know that to be a muslim is to not just believe... but it is to also submit. You belive and have the true intention that Islam is the true religion </p>
<p>In order to effectivley do this, you would need some moral and common knowledge of course... the first thing we will discuss is the basic prayers </p> <hr/>
<h2> The 5 Fard prayers</h2>
<p> Fard prayers are the prayers that are mandatory, every muslim needs to pray them </p>
 <ul>
<li>
1. Fajr (the morning prayer that has 2 rakats)</li>
<li>
2. Duhr (the afternoon prayer that has 4 rakats)</li>
<li>
3. Asr (the late afternoon prayer that has 4 rakats)</li>
<li>
4. Maghrib (the sunset prayer
that has 3 rakats)</li>
<li>
5. Isha (the midnight prayer that has 4 rakats) </li>
</ul>
 </hr>
<ul>
<h2>
The wajib prayer are the obligatory specific situation prayer that is special include</h2>
 <li> the funeral prayer</li>
<li>
the eid prayer</li> 
<li> the tawaf prayer</li>
<li>
the jumah prayer</li>
<li>
the witr prayer</li>
</ul> 
<h2>
The sunnah prayer are extra... but this is not true... the sunnah is really really heavily empathasized and to be honest you should just
consider them
as mandatory prayer as well.</h2>

<h3>Before and after a obligatory prayer 1 </h3>
<ul>
<li>
2 rakats before Fajr</li>
<li> 4 rakats before Duhr and 2 rakats after</1i>
<li>
2 rakats after Maghrib</1i>
<li> 2 rakats after Isha</li>
</ul>
<h1> the last type of prayer is Nafl, which is a voluntary prayer</h1> 
<ul>
<li>tarawih</1i>
<li>tahhajjud</li>
<li>duha</li>
<li> awwabin</li>
<li> wudu </li>
<li>eclipse prayer</li>
<li>rain prayer</li>
</ul> 
<h1> The second topic I'll dive into is the 2 sets of pillars ( Islam is built upon these pillars)</h1>
<p></p>
Now remember when I said "to be a muslim is to not just believe... but it is to also submit. You belive and have the true intention that Islam is the true religion and you also submit to
</p>

<p>This is when this will make sense because there are 2 set of pillars in which, one is for suming up submission and the other is for suming up the belief </p>
<hr>
<h2>The 5 pillars of Islam</h2>
<ul>
<li> testifying allah is one and that Muhammad is the messenger (shahadda)
</1i>

<li> submiting prayers</li>

<li>giving charity</li>

<li> performing the pilgrimage (Hajj)
</li>

<li> fasting during the month of Ramadan</1i>
</ul>
<p>

The 5 pillars of islam are the outward actions that show and summarize how you submit to allah</p>
<h2> The 6 pillars of Iman </h2> <ul>

<li>

belief in allah (that he is one and the absolute creator of everything) </li>

<li>

belief in the angels ( that they are real servants of allah) </li>

<li> belief in the books (torah, bible, psamls, gospel of davud, scrolls of ibrahim, and the quran)</li>

<li> belief in his messengers(all of the 25 prophets mentioned in the quran and the other 124,000 )</li>

<li>

belief in the day of judgment (that you will be held acountable and there is heaven and hell) </li>

<li>

belief in divine decree (that everything, good or bad, happens by allah's will) </li>

</ul>
<p> The pillars of Iman are the inward actions that show you belief and summarize how you think and trust of Islam </p> 
<hr>
